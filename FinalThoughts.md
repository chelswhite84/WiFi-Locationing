#FINAL THOUGHTS
Although I was impressed with the results of using classification and regression to predict a personâ€™s location indoors, the models can continue to be optimized to improve their performance. If time is an issue with running these models, say if you want to know where someone is within a few seconds, this may not be the best way to approach that problem. Additionally, the data can be improved by removing any WAP readings that do not have an readings notated, i.e. have a RSSI of 100. Finally, the attribute SPACEID could be further examined to determine if there is any weird occurrences with the values, do values repeat, are some numbers skipped, etc, so optimize this variable.
