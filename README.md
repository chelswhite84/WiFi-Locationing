# WiFi-Locationing
Tackling a deep analytics problem to determine how Classification and Regression can be used to predict where a person is located indoors. View the following pages to see how I tackled the problem by subseting the data, cleaning up attributes, creating a new attributes, and breaking the predictions into two steps using first Classification and then Regression.

To present these findings to interested parties, I have also created a [PowerPoint presentation] (https://github.com/chelswhite84/WiFi-Locationing/blob/master/WiFiLocationing%20Presentation.pptx).
