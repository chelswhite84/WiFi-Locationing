ABOUT THE DATA 
The UJIndoorLoc database was created in 2013 and includes over 20,000 lines of collected location data. This data covers 3 buildings at the Universitat Jaume I. A person’s location data includes BUILDINGID, FLOOR, SPACEID, and RELATIVEPOSITION (if they were inside or outside the classroom or office), as well as 520 Wireless Access Point (WAP) readings. Each of the listed WAP readings shows the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI), which range from 0dBM to -104dBm. A positive value of 100 means a WAP was not detected. Using the RSSI values for specific WAPs can then determine a person’s location indoors, i.e. their WiFi Fingerprint.
